                    Bishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in Klerksdorp South Africa, with a Xhosa and Mostwana heritage. 
    This Anglican bishop and theologian is well known for his anti-apartheid activism and speaking out on controversial matters (such as gay rights and female priests). Although this lead to some criticism, he was also able to achieve being the first African bishop of Johannesburg and Archbishop of Cape Town, he also won a Nobel Peace Prize and helped Nelson Mandela negotiate the end of apartheid – amongst other things. 
    Bishop Tutu preached non-violence and was vocal about his support of the “Palestines in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict [and] his opposition to the Iraq war” (Wikipedia, 2021). He was also vocal about his support of gay rights and once said that he “would not worship a God who is homophobic”.
    He is a well respected man in South Africa and all over the world. To read more about him, you can visit  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">his Wikipedia page</a>.
